# odin-landing-page
Hi! This repository is for my project: Landing Page from theodinproject.com

Please note that this covers only basic html and css thus not making (for the meantime) this landing page responsive to mobiles. I am following the directions first and treating myself as a beginner even though I have already done a portfolio which is reponsive on my other repository: https://github.com/kryyyo/webportfolio 

Thank you!
